# Contacting Companies
## What is a cover letter?
Your __first impression__. This is the initial contact between you and a company you're interested in working for. You'll usually attach (or link to) your resume/LinkedIn profile in this email.

## How to Make First Contact
### Be Creative
Elliott's theory is that applying to a company via their career site/submitting a resume and cover letter __SHOULD ALWAYS BE YOUR LAST RESORT__. This approach works, but it's the same approach that 97% of job seekers in your shoes are taking. Applying to a career site works and you can land a job by doing so. But if you take other, more *creative*, strategic routes, you will be sure to stand out amongst everyone else applying to the same opportunities.

When pursuing companies you always want to first try and pursue them by:

1. Getting introduced by someone you know to someone at that company.
2. Find a way to meet someone from that company in person either at a meet up, user group, conference, etc.

Start Sleuthing! You can find people's Twitter handles, email addresses or Meetup names just by trying the same username on another service. For example, have an engineer's Github profile name and want to follow them or ping them on Twitter....maybe they use the same name!

If you can't do either of those, I suggest then doing this:

3. Find a company.
  * Does that company have an engineering blog? If so, find it and read as much as you can. The more the better.
  * Find the names of engineers from that company using LinkedIn or the companies website/about us page.
  * Then find those engineers on github, read their code, explore their projects learn about them. 
  * Find their twitter, find their personal sites. Read up on them.. read as much as you can. 
  * Find something they posted or wrote that really resonates with you and email them about that. Get the conversation started. don't email a bunch people/companies saying the same thing over and over "I really like your company, noticed you're hiring and would love an opportunity to chat with you, etc. etc."
  * Instead, research engineers at the companies you're interested in, find something you can relate or connect with them regarding and write them a short a sweet email complimenting something they did, wrote, posted, etc. 
  * When writing an email to someone you don't know, write the email for one reason and one reason only: to get a response. Forget all the job stuff and the fact you're looking for a job and just be human. Get dialogue going with people by complimenting and flattering them. Try and meet them if you're in the same city. Then once you have the conversation going and a rapport built, bring up the fact you're looking for a job and interested in their company.

## Netorking 101
Don't forget the obvious: eye contact, personal hygiene (clean finger nails! no boogers!)

### Preparing for a Networking Event
* Figure out who will be there. What have they done? Lookup their pictures & bios.
* Find out who you want to talk to
