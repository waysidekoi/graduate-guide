# Contacting Companies
## What is a cover letter?
Your __first impression__. This is the initial contact between you and a company you're interested in working for. You'll usually attach (or link to) your resume/LinkedIn profile in this email.

## How to Make First Contact
### Be Creative
Elliot's theory is that applying to a company via their career site/submitting a resume and cover letter __SHOULD ALWAYS BE YOUR LAST RESORT__. This approach works, but it's the same approach that 97% of job seekers in your shoes are taking. Applying to a career site works and you can land a job by doing so. But if you take other, more *creative*, strategic routes, you will be sure to stand out amongst everyone else applying to the same opportunities.

When pursuing companies you always want to first try and pursue them by:

1. Getting introduced by someone you know to someone at that company.
2. Find a way to meet someone from that company in person either at a meet up, user group, conference, etc.

If you can't do either of those, I suggest then doing this:

3. Find a company.
  * Does that company have an engineering blog? If so, find it and read as much as you can. The more the better.
  * Find the names of engineers from that company using LinkedIn or the companies website/about us page.
  * Then find those engineers on github, read their code, explore their projects learn about them. 
  * Find their twitter, find their personal sites. Read up on them.. read as much as you can. 
  * Find something they posted or wrote that really resonates with you and email them about that. Get the conversation started. don't email a bunch people/companies saying the same thing over and over "I really like your company, noticed you're hiring and would love an opportunity to chat with you, etc. etc."
  * Instead, research engineers at the companies you're interested in, find something you can relate or connect with them regarding and write them a short a sweet email complimenting something they did, wrote, posted, etc. 
  * Get dialogue going with people by complimenting and flattering them. Try and meet them if you're in the same city. Then once you have the conversation going and a rapport built, bring up the fact you're looking for a job and interested in their company.
