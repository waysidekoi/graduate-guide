# Continued Learning

* [Myles response to "what should I be reading?"](https://gist.github.com/quackingduck/3a6f72b61a733ff31695)
* [The Danger of Becoming an Expert](https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/231d7499a75)
* [Confreaks](http://confreaks.com)
* Check out [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io) if you'd like to hone your Ruby chops. You work on one assignment at a time and get feedback from other programmers and can offer feedback on assignments once you've leveled up. There are also problems in JavaScript, Haskell, Elixir, Clojure, and Python if Ruby is too mundane. I've found the site really useful.
