# Presenting Yourself

## Resumes
Have Elliot, your mentor(s) and me take a look at your resumes. Tell more about yourself than the traditional stuff. I enjoy seeing:

* Open source contributions detailed
* Books you've read recently
* List technologies based on level of expertise
* [Forget the Resume, kill on the cover letter](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1748-forget-the-resume-kill-on-the-cover-letter)

## Personal Site
Try [Github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator) (with Jekyll)

Some examples of personal sites:

__SHOW PROGRESS__ Don't hide your 'bad' early work. Let the world know how you've grown. Humility is a highly prized value in this industry.


## Github Profile
Clean up any cruft. Todo:

* Remove unprofessional stuff (anything that might be offensive, i.e. swear words)
* Empty projects (forks that were never modified)
* Lack of tests (add some)
* Missing READMEs
* Ensure your project can be cloned and run without errors
* __SHOW PROGRESS__
* Do some things that are lower level or outside the typical stack of a web developer. These projects are great conversation pieces during an interview.

## Tools
* Google/Twitter/Github are your starting points for getting a peek inside a company.
* [Rapportive](http://rapportive.com) Embeds social network from the people you email with into Gmail. ("twitter handle is @NNNNNN [follow]")
* [The Muse](http://www.themuse.com/)
* [Coderwall](coderwall.com)
