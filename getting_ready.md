# Getting Ready
## Cover Letters
Insert some info about writing a great cover letter.

* [Forget the Resume, kill on the cover letter](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1748-forget-the-resume-kill-on-the-cover-letter)

## Things to Read or Watch
* [How to Get Hired When You're Just Starting Out](http://99u.com/articles/7275/How-to-Get-Hired-When-You-Are-Just-Starting-Out)
* [Always Be Coding](https://medium.com/tech-talk/d5f8051afce2)
* [Building a Brand without Being Douchey](http://vimeo.com/71685072)

## Resume
Have Elliot, your mentor(s) and me take a look at your resumes. Here are some of the basics you'll want to include:

__Header:__ Name, Address, Phone Number, email, github, personal site

__About Me:__ short and sweet blurb about you

__Skills:__ Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, TDD. Do you have any other skills you bring from a previous career?

__Personal Projects:__ What are you proud of? Show it off!

__Experience:__ Be sure to use dates! Add Dev Bootcamp under Experience. If you stay for phase 4 add TA as your job title and leverage the fact you are doing code reviews, mentoring students, helping them refactor their apps, etc.

__Education:__ Be sure to use dates! This should be your footer. Add dev Bootcamp but keep it short and sweet "9 week intensive web development bootcamp"


Consider including non-traditional items. I enjoy seeing:

* Open source contributions detailed
* Books you've read recently
* List technologies based on level of expertise


## LinkedIn
### Summary
Keep your linked in summary short and sweet and unique. Talk about what you bring to the table because of your background and tie it to how it helps you be a more effective developer. Talk about what your dream job is.

### How to Describe Your time at DBC
Put Dev Bootcamp as an "Experience" instead of "Education" so that you have more control of where it shows up on the page

### Projects
Put each of the projects you're proud of at Dev Bootcamp (Say, final project, phase 2 final projects) as linked in projects so that people see how you're skills have grown

## Personal Site
### Options
* Try [Github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator) (with Jekyll)
* For those of you without a personal blog, set up a http://coderwall.com profile, and make that your website on LinkedIn.

Some examples of personal sites:

* [Mitch](http://dontmitch.github.io/)
* [Andrew](http://www.devsquirrel.com/dev)
* [Codesnippets (Liz)](http://www.codesnippets.io/)
* [Trevor Turk](http://trevorturk.com/37signals/)
* [Sites that landed jobs at 37 Signals](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2709-sites-that-landed-jobs-at-37signals)

__SHOW PROGRESS__ Don't hide your 'bad' early work. Let the world know how you've grown. Humility is a highly prized value in this industry.

## Github Profile
### Clean up any cruft:

* Remove unprofessional stuff (anything that might be offensive, i.e. swear words)
* Empty projects (forks that were never modified)
* Lack of tests (add some)
* Missing READMEs
* Ensure your project can be cloned and run without errors
* __SHOW PROGRESS__
* Do some things that are lower level or outside the typical stack of a web developer. These projects are great conversation pieces during an interview.

### Highlight Your Best Work
Fork your final projects to your repository, and ask people to star the 5 projects you're most proud of so they show up as the popular repositories on your github page

## Tools
* Google/Twitter/Github are your starting points for getting a peek inside a company.
* [Rapportive](http://rapportive.com) Embeds social network from the people you email with into Gmail. ("twitter handle is @NNNNNN [follow]")
* [The Muse](http://www.themuse.com/)
