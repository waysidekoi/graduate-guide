        <h1 id='contacting_companies'>Contacting Companies</h1>

<h2 id='what_is_a_cover_letter'>What is a cover letter?</h2>

<p>Your <strong>first impression</strong>. This is the initial contact between you and a company you&#8217;re interested in working for. You&#8217;ll usually attach (or link to) your resume/LinkedIn profile in this email.</p>

<h2 id='how_to_make_first_contact'>How to Make First Contact</h2>

<h3 id='be_creative'>Be Creative</h3>

<p>Elliot&#8217;s theory is that applying to a company via their career site/submitting a resume and cover letter <strong>SHOULD ALWAYS BE YOUR LAST RESORT</strong>. This approach works, but it&#8217;s the same approach that 97% of job seekers in your shoes are taking. Applying to a career site works and you can land a job by doing so. But if you take other, more <em>creative</em>, strategic routes, you will be sure to stand out amongst everyone else applying to the same opportunities.</p>

<p>When pursuing companies you always want to first try and pursue them by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Getting introduced by someone you know to someone at that company.</li>

<li>Find a way to meet someone from that company in person either at a meet up, user group, conference, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Start Sleuthing! You can find people&#8217;s Twitter handles, email addresses or Meetup names just by trying the same username on another service. For example, have an engineer&#8217;s Github profile name and want to follow them or ping them on Twitter&#8230;.maybe they use the same name!</p>

<p>If you can&#8217;t do either of those, I suggest then doing this:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Find a company.</p>

<ul>
<li>Does that company have an engineering blog? If so, find it and read as much as you can. The more the better.</li>

<li>Find the names of engineers from that company using LinkedIn or the companies website/about us page.</li>

<li>Then find those engineers on github, read their code, explore their projects learn about them.</li>

<li>Find their twitter, find their personal sites. Read up on them.. read as much as you can.</li>

<li>Find something they posted or wrote that really resonates with you and email them about that. Get the conversation started. don&#8217;t email a bunch people/companies saying the same thing over and over &#8220;I really like your company, noticed you&#8217;re hiring and would love an opportunity to chat with you, etc. etc.&#8221;</li>

<li>Instead, research engineers at the companies you&#8217;re interested in, find something you can relate or connect with them regarding and write them a short a sweet email complimenting something they did, wrote, posted, etc.</li>

<li>Get dialogue going with people by complimenting and flattering them. Try and meet them if you&#8217;re in the same city. Then once you have the conversation going and a rapport built, bring up the fact you&#8217;re looking for a job and interested in their company.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='netorking_101'>Netorking 101</h2>

<p>Don&#8217;t forget the obvious: eye contact, personal hygiene (clean finger nails! no boogers!)</p>

<h3 id='preparing_for_a_networking_event'>Preparing for a Networking Event</h3>

<ul>
<li>Figure out who will be there. What have they done? Lookup their pictures &amp; bios.</li>

<li>Find out who you want to talk to</li>
</ul>
