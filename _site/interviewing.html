<h2 id='advice'>Advice</h2>

<ul>
<li>Research the heck out of the company you are interviewing with. There is no such thing as being over prepared. Read every single page on their website. Read the companies blog. Does the company have an engineering blog? If so, read every single post. Does the company have a company github? If so, read everything. Do the engineers at that company have a twitter? Read it. Do they have a blog or personal site? Read it. Do they have a github? Look at their code. Does this company use certain technologies a lot? If so, brush up on them. start a project a before you interview as a way to brush up and something to reference when they ask you about technology X - &#8220;No i haven&#8217;t worked with it much but after researching you guys I realized you use it a lot so I started a project. It&#8217;s actually really cool, I like how technology X offers you the ability to do X, Y, Z blah blah blah. you get the point. Seriously, the more you research the better you will interview. I know this for sure.</li>

<li>Confirm your interview the day before.</li>

<li>Show up for your interview 15 minutes early.</li>

<li>Interview dress code: Always dress a notch up. Overdressed is better than under dressed. You don&#8217;t want to wear a suit and tie to interview at a startup where everyone is wearing shorts and flip flops. But if you wear a nice pair of jeans, a belt, nice shoes, and a tucked in dress shirt, you won&#8217;t look out of place but you will look nice, and it will tell the company that the interview means a lot to you and you&#8217;re taking it serious.</li>

<li>Smile, if you&#8217;re nervous admit it to the interviewers!! This is huge, seriously if you&#8217;re nervous and try to hide it it will show and make you look bad, if you&#8217;re nervous and you admit it right off the bat, the person interviewing will want to make you comfortable and won&#8217;t judge you while you&#8217;re nerves are freaking out.</li>

<li>Give a good hand shake.</li>

<li>Get business cards of everyone you meet/interview with. If they don&#8217;t have cards, write down their names. When you get back from the interview send thank you notes to everyone you met. If you don&#8217;t have emails for everyone send it to the people you have emails for and ask them to forward it to the others who&#8217;s email you don&#8217;t have.</li>

<li>If you get stuck on a coding problem (pairing/whiteboarding/etc) re-do the problem when you get home and send the solution. When I worked at Groupon, a few folks choked on whiteboard or pairing problems. Following their interview they knew how to solve the problem so they went ahead and re-did it, wrote a solution, and sent it back. This went a long way.</li>
</ul>

<li>Read every post on companies engineering blog.</li>

<li>Find company on Github - Study their code. Do a tutorial for each technolgy the night before to make sure you are sharp for your interview. If the company is using technologies you&#8217;re not expereinced with then start a project a before you interview as a way to brush up and something to reference when they ask you about technology X - &#8220;No i haven&#8217;t worked with it much but after researching you guys I realized you use it a lot so I started a project. It&#8217;s actually really cool, I like how technology X offers you the ability to do X, Y, Z blah blah blah. you get the point.</li>
