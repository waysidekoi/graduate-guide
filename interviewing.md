## Advice

* Research the heck out of the company you are interviewing with. There is no such thing as being over prepared. Read every single page on their website. Read the companies blog. Does the company have an engineering blog? If so, read every single post. Does the company have a company github? If so, read everything. Do the engineers at that company have a twitter? Read it. Do they have a blog or personal site? Read it. Do they have a github? Look at their code. Does this company use certain technologies a lot? If so, brush up on them. start a project a before you interview as a way to brush up and something to reference when they ask you about technology X - "No i haven't worked with it much but after researching you guys I realized you use it a lot so I started a project. It's actually really cool, I like how technology X offers you the ability to do X, Y, Z blah blah blah. you get the point. Seriously, the more you research the better you will interview. I know this for sure.
* Confirm your interview the day before.
* Show up for your interview 15 minutes early.
* Interview dress code: Always dress a notch up. Overdressed is better than under dressed. You don't want to wear a suit and tie to interview at a startup where everyone is wearing shorts and flip flops. But if you wear a nice pair of jeans, a belt, nice shoes, and a tucked in dress shirt, you won't look out of place but you will look nice, and it will tell the company that the interview means a lot to you and you're taking it serious.
* Smile, if you're nervous admit it to the interviewers!! This is huge, seriously if you're nervous and try to hide it it will show and make you look bad, if you're nervous and you admit it right off the bat, the person interviewing will want to make you comfortable and won't judge you while you're nerves are freaking out.
* Give a good hand shake.
* Get business cards of everyone you meet/interview with. If they don't have cards, write down their names. When you get back from the interview send thank you notes to everyone you met. If you don't have emails for everyone send it to the people you have emails for and ask them to forward it to the others who's email you don't have.
* If you get stuck on a coding problem (pairing/whiteboarding/etc) re-do the problem when you get home and send the solution. When I worked at Groupon, a few folks choked on whiteboard or pairing problems. Following their interview they knew how to solve the problem so they went ahead and re-did it, wrote a solution, and sent it back. This went a long way.


### Interview Checklist:

* Read every word on every page of companies website
* Read every post on the companies blog.
* Read every post on companies engineering blog.
* Find company on Github - Study their code.  Do a tutorial for each technolgy the night before to make sure you are sharp for your interview. If the company is using technologies you're not expereinced with then start a project a before you interview as a way to brush up and something to reference when they ask you about technology X - "No i haven't worked with it much but after researching you guys I realized you use it a lot so I started a project. It's actually really cool, I like how technology X offers you the ability to do X, Y, Z blah blah blah. you get the point.

### Be able to answer these questions about the company before your interview:

* What are the top 3 technologies they seem to be using most?
* What are they using those technologies for?
* What is/are the founder(s) stories?
* How do they make money?
* Who is their competition?
* What problem are they solving?
* How many products does the company have? 

## Interview Prep

### Plug your gaps
Identify your gaps in knowledge. Plug those gaps __before__ the interview. If you're applying for a Junior Dev Full Stack position, consider these topics to be fair game:

* OO Design Patterns
  * Describe encapsulation. Open up an editor and code me an example of encapsulation.
  * Desribe polymorphism. How is polymorphism accomplished in strongly typed languages? How is it accomplished in weakly typed languages?
  * When would you use inheritence? What are it's benefits and drawbacks?
  * What is a class?
  * What is an object? Are only instances of classes objects?
* Standard Algorithms -- You don't need to memorize these, but should be able to implement them given a description.
  * Sorting (insertion, merge, bubble)
  * Linear Search
  * Binary Search
* Data structures (be able to implement these in the language of your choice)
  * Array
  * Hash
  * Linked List, Double Linked List
  * Set
* How the internet works
  * What's the difference between the internet and the web?
  * What are some common networking protocols?
  * What is DNS?
  * What's an IP address?
  * What is a packet?
  * What does routing do?
* How HTTP works
  * Desribe an HTTP request and response.
  * HTTP is stateless, what does that mean?
  * What technique is used to track state over HTTP?
  * What is an HTTP response code? What are some common codes?
* Plain ol' Ruby
  * Classes
  * Modules
  * Objects
  * class methods, instance methods
  * method_missing
  * Blocks/procs/lamdas
  * self
  * public/protected/private
  * Enumberable
* Plain ol' Javascript
* TDD
  * Can you write an rspec test outside of Rails?
